## Adding support for a service
Please submit a pull request if you'd like to use Shields badges for a project that isn't yet supported, I'll gladly add them to the repository.

## Shields-as-a-Service
Our long term goal is to transform Shields into a service with which widely compatible badges can be generated via a simple API call, any help with this would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
@olivierlacan
