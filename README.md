# Shields

A coherent info-badge solution for codebases.

## Problem
An increasing number of GitHub repos sport badges for things like:
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) build status: 

![travis badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/2H233M0I0T43313c3h0C/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.45.30%20AM.png)

- [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com/) dependency checks: 

![gemnasium badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/2j1D2R0q2C3s1x2y3k09/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.46.10%20AM.png)

- [Code Climate](http://codeclimate.com): 

![code climate badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/0H2O1A3q2b3j1D2i0M3j/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.46.47%20AM.png)

- [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org) released gem version: 

![rubygems badge](http://f.cl.ly/items/443X21151h1V301s2s3a/Screen%20Shot%202013-01-30%20at%202.47.10%20AM.png)

As you can see from the zoomed 400% verisons of these badges above, nobody is (really) using the same badge file and at normal size, they're hardly legible.

## Solution
As you can see below, without increasing the footprint of these badges, I've tried to increase legibility and coherence, removing useless text to decrease the horizontal length in the (likely) scenario that more of these badge thingies crop up on READMEs all acros the land.

You can find a Photoshop CS6 PSD file containing the simple shapes and non-destructive styles I applied to create these. I spend exactly 5 minutes looking for a more legible font at small size and while I'm absolutely open to suggestions for a better one, settled on Calibri which is owned by Microsoft. It's clearly not an ideal candidate, but I think it works well here, please submit a pull request with a suitable alternative (and a preview of it) if you find one.
